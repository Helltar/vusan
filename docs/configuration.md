# Configuration

Config comes from environment variables (or a `.env` file in the working directory). [`.env.example`](../.env.example) is a copy-paste template; this page says what each variable does.

## Required

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). |
| `ALLOWED_IDS` | Comma-separated Telegram IDs the bot responds to. Positive = user, negative = group. Empty/unset = ignores everything. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | LLM API key. Required unless you switch `LLM_PROVIDER` (see below). |

## LLM provider

`LLM_PROVIDER` selects the backend (default `openai`). The chosen model must support tool calling.

| Provider | Required | Optional (default) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `OPENAI_MODEL` (`gpt-5.4-nano`) |
| `ollama` | `OLLAMA_MODEL` (e.g. `gemma4`) | `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (`http://localhost:11434`) |
| `openai-compatible` | `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` (any non-empty), `OPENAI_MODEL` | — |

`openai-compatible` targets any server exposing OpenAI's `/v1/chat/completions` — e.g. [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) (`http://localhost:8080`) or [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) (`http://localhost:1234/v1`).

## Persona

The bot ships with a built-in persona ("Vusan"). Override it to run your own character — describe identity, tone, and language; the operational rules (output/tool contract) are always appended by the bot and can't be broken by a custom persona. Unset both to use the default.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SYSTEM_PROMPT` | Inline persona text. Takes precedence when set. |
| `SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE` | Path to a persona file (handy for multi-line text). Read only when `SYSTEM_PROMPT` is unset; a set-but-unreadable path fails startup. |

## Optional features

Each feature is gated by one env variable (an API key or service URL). If it's missing, that tool is skipped at startup with a `WARN` log and the bot runs without it.

| Feature | Gate | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web search, image search, page extraction (Tavily) | `TAVILY_API_KEY` | — |
| GIF lookup (Giphy) | `GIPHY_API_KEY` | — |
| Voice output — TTS (ElevenLabs) | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | tuning below |
| Voice input — STT | `OPENAI_STT_API_KEY` | reuse `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you have one |
| Code sandbox — `runCode` tool | `SANDBOX_URL` | see [Code sandbox](#code-sandbox) |

### TTS tuning

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` | `VD1if7jDVYtAKs4P0FIY` (Milly Maple — Cool and Bright) |
| `ELEVENLABS_TTS_MODEL` | `eleven_v3` |
| `ELEVENLABS_TTS_OUTPUT_FORMAT` | `mp3_44100_128` |

### STT tuning

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_STT_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-transcribe` |
| `OPENAI_STT_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS` | `300` — longer messages get a "too long" reply |

### Code sandbox

`runCode` lets the agent run Python in an isolated sandbox to compute exact answers, transform data, and render charts (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sympy`). Unlike the other features, `SANDBOX_URL` is not an API key but the URL of the bundled **sandbox service** — it executes untrusted code on an internal-only network with no secrets, no internet, and no host mounts.

Start the service, then point the bot at it:

```bash
docker compose --profile sandbox up -d
```

`SANDBOX_URL=http://sandbox:8080` matches the compose service. Unset → the tool is skipped.

The `sandbox` container reads these (all optional, set on that service — not the bot):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SANDBOX_POOL_SIZE` | `2` | Warm Pyodide workers kept ready. |
| `SANDBOX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `30` | Hard per-run limit; a stuck script is killed. Higher = more render time for animations but a worker stays busy longer. |
| `PORT` | `8080` | Port the service listens on. |

## Scheduled tasks

Built in. The agent schedules tasks in one of three forms:

- `once <datetime>` — fires once; if missed, fires late with a notice.
- `every <interval>` — fixed interval (min 5 minutes), timezone-independent; missed fires skip ahead.
- `cron <UNIX expr>` — clock-time / specific-day patterns (e.g. weekdays at 18:00), evaluated in the task's timezone (JVM default unless the request names a city or IANA zone); missed fires skip ahead.

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `MAX_TASKS_PER_USER` | `10` |
| `TASK_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `30` |
| `TASK_MAX_LATENESS_MINUTES` | `60` — recurring only; skip a fire older than this |

## Storage and tooling

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_FILE` | `data/db/vusan.db` | SQLite path. Parent dirs auto-created on first run. |
| `YT_DLP_PATH` | `yt-dlp` | Path to the `yt-dlp` binary. |
| `YT_DLP_COOKIES_FILE` | — | Netscape-format `cookies.txt` for YouTube auth. See the [yt-dlp wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#exporting-youtube-cookies). |
