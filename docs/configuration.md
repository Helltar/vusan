# Configuration

All configuration is read from environment variables (or a `.env` file in the working directory). This page is the source of truth for required vs optional behavior; [`.env.example`](../.env.example) is a copyable template with example values.

## Required

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). |
| `ALLOWED_IDS` | Comma-separated Telegram IDs the bot will respond to. Positive = user (private chat), negative = group/channel. Empty/unset = bot ignores every message. |

Plus the keys for the active LLM provider (see [LLM provider](#llm-provider) below). With the default `LLM_PROVIDER=openai`, that means `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## LLM provider

`LLM_PROVIDER` selects the LLM backend. Default `openai`. Each provider has its own set of required/optional variables.

### `openai` (default)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — (required) | OpenAI API key for the agent LLM and vision. |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-5.4-nano` | OpenAI model ID. |

### `ollama`

Run the agent against a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) instance. Pick a model that advertises tool support (e.g. `llama3.1`, `qwen2.5`); models without `tools` capability won't be able to call any of the bot's tools.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | — (required) | Ollama model ID, e.g. `llama3.1`. The model must be pulled on the Ollama instance ahead of time (`ollama pull llama3.1`). |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Base URL of the Ollama HTTP API. |

### `openai-compatible`

Point the OpenAI client at any local server that exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint: `llama.cpp` `llama-server`, [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), text-generation-webui, etc. The model must support tool calling for the bot's tools to work.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | — (required) | Base URL of the local server, e.g. `http://localhost:8080` for `llama-server` or `http://localhost:1234/v1` for LM Studio. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — (required) | Use any non-empty value if the local server ignores the header (most do — they just require it to be present). |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | — (required) | Model ID as advertised by the local server's `/v1/models` endpoint. |

## Optional — feature toggles

If the API key for one of these is missing, the corresponding tool is unregistered at startup with a `WARN` log entry. The bot still runs; the agent just doesn't have access to that capability.

| Variable | Disables when missing |
| --- | --- |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Web search, image search, and page extraction tools. |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | Voice / text-to-speech tool. |
| `GIPHY_API_KEY` | GIF lookup tool. |

## Optional — settings and defaults

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` | `VD1if7jDVYtAKs4P0FIY` | ElevenLabs voice ID. Default voice: Milly Maple - Cool and Bright. |
| `ELEVENLABS_TTS_MODEL` | `eleven_v3` | ElevenLabs TTS model ID. |
| `ELEVENLABS_TTS_OUTPUT_FORMAT` | `mp3_44100_128` | ElevenLabs audio output format. |
| `DB_FILE` | `data/db/vusan.db` | Path to the SQLite database file (created on first run, parent directories auto-created). |
| `YT_DLP_PATH` | `yt-dlp` | Path to the `yt-dlp` binary. |
| `YT_DLP_COOKIES_FILE` | — | Netscape-format `cookies.txt` for YouTube auth. See the [yt-dlp wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#exporting-youtube-cookies). |
